# MinimaxAB

Code by Matthew Barton.

Done as the final project for Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-3344-1 Spring 2020) at Trinity University (TX) with Dr. Albert Xin Jiang.

This repository includes a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning that plays Tic-Tac-Toe and Checkers against a human.
Graphics and user input are handled by the pygame library.
